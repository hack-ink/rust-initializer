# Documentation Index

Purpose: Provide the canonical entry point and reading order for repository documentation.

## Start here

- `AGENTS.md` for automated agent rules and tooling constraints.
- `docs/spec/index.md` for normative system specifications and contracts.
- `docs/guide/index.md` for operational guides and runbooks.
- `docs/governance.md` for documentation structure and update rules.
- `docs/plans/` for Claude-generated execution plans (non-normative).
